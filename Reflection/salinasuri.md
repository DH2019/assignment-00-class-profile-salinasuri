# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

This basic "flip card book" layout can serve to accessibly present "bites" of information related to a central subject. Such a platform would hold a pedagogical purpose for historians or humanists by providing a centralized cache of introductory (overview)information. For example, a historian of medicine may choose to create a website featuring cards that would each focus on a historical disease. Such an archive would have the potential to gather images and information on these diseases, providing conncise but directly relevant information at a glance. This information would be accessible by researchers, acting as a centralized "starting point" on a topic that is often difficult to research. 

## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

This project highlights issues to do with the ethicality of information sharing. Each "card" contains potentially sensitive information, including contact and personal details. As a result, the researcher holds responsibilities that include: confidential management of information and privacy settings to prevent the virtual sharing of the information. The end product (the website) would be required to uphold those responsibilities, thus only releasing information as permitted by the participants. However, the participants themselves likely do not have a right to police that information, as long as the previously agreed upon terms re:information  distribution are upheld. Essentially, we (the participants) have willingly divested this information, by enrolling in the course and then committing the information to the website. We therefore have agreeed to allow our information to become accessible to the researcher, thus waiving our rights to this information so long as it is not used to harm us. Thus, this is not only an exercise in website building and information sharing, but also a lesson on the lack of control that we are able to exact over information that we have shared online.

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

To create a website on the history of medicine, with a focus on diseases, the cards would include fields like: diagnosis, symptoms, effects, vectors, location of infections, historical statistics, and current statistics (if applicable). By categorizing these factors, it may be difficult for the researcher to understand how they affect each other. For example, how vectors managed to bring a disease from Europe to North America, which would require an interrelated understanding of 3 factors: historical statistics, vectors, **and** the location of infections. Thus, the structure of these flip cards is such that only very basic information can really be gleaned from them, as the more complex relationships between the various factors would not be obvious with just the "trading card." This would be the rationale for using this archive to link to other scholarly articles, to provide further background and elaboration based on sources compiled by participants for researchers.
